# Amber
Site layout based on PSD file taken from https://stylemixthemes.com/freebies/amber-free-psd/ .

Tools: Html, Css, Sass, Javascript, jQuery, Gulp.

Site itself is created with grid made durning lectures in Coder's Lab (https://github.com/Raudos/myGrid) which is based
on all the basic features of Bootstrap plus few additions added on my own. For the live version css has added all prefixes,
minified and gziped, Javascript file also got uglified.

Css Reset file made by http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/

with width bigger than 1500px jquery adds automated paddings, that make the rows wider while keeping the contents intact.
